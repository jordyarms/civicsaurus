**Our playbook is organized into three key sections**:

1. [Principles](category/1-principles) – Discover the core values and guiding principles that underpin effective civic tech projects. Learn how to center your work on user needs, embrace openness and transparency, iterate responsively, and build sustainable solutions.
2. [Ways of Working](category/2-ways-of-working) – Explore the invisible design activities that support and enhance your project throughout its lifecycle. From setting a clear vision to building strong relationships, these practices will help you navigate complex challenges and drive meaningful change.
3. [Project Lifecycle](category/3-project-lifecycle) – Follow our adapted double diamond approach to guide your project from initial concept to real-world impact. Learn key activities and considerations for each phase: Explore, Reframe, Create, and Catalyze.

Each section provides practical guidance, tips, and real-world examples to help you apply these concepts to your own civic tech projects. Remember, civic tech is about more than just building software—it's about creating positive change in our communities through collaborative, user-centered, and impactful solutions.

We encourage you to explore each section, adapt the guidance to your specific context, and contribute your own experiences and insights to the ever-growing field of civic technology.

Let's build a better future for our communities, together!
