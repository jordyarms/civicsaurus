- Inspires and motivates participants by connecting day-to-day work to larger goals
- Facilitates clearer communication about the project's intentions and expected outcomes

## How to practice:

1. **Define your purpose**:  Clearly articulate why your project exists and what specific community need it addresses.
2. **Set clear goals**:  Establish concrete, measurable objectives that align with your overall purpose.
3. **Develop a shared vision**:  Collaboratively create a compelling vision of the future your project aims to bring about.
4. **Identify core values**:  Define the principles that will guide your project's decisions and actions.
5. **Analyze context**:  Research the broader ecosystem in which your project operates, including existing initiatives and potential challenges.
6. **Create alignment**:  Ensure all team members and key stakeholders understand and buy into the project's direction.
