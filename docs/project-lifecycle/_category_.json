    "description": "The project lifecycle in civic tech is a dynamic and iterative process that guides your work from initial concept to real-world impact. Inspired by the Design Council's double diamond approach, our lifecycle model emphasizes both divergent and convergent thinking, ensuring that we thoroughly explore challenges and potential solutions before focusing our efforts. This approach helps create civic tech solutions that are innovative, user-centered, and truly impactful. – These phases are not strictly linear; you may find yourself moving back and forth between them as you learn and iterate. Each phase incorporates user involvement, research, and testing to ensure your project remains aligned with community needs and goals. – By following this lifecycle, you can create civic tech solutions that are not only technically sound but also deeply rooted in community needs and poised for lasting impact."
