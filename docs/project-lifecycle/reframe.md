The Reframe phase is about synthesizing your research findings to clearly define the problem you're addressing. It involves challenging assumptions, identifying core issues, and setting a clear direction for your project.

## Why it matters:

- Ensures you're solving the right problem, not just symptoms
- Helps focus your efforts on areas with the highest potential impact
- Aligns your team and stakeholders around a shared understanding
- Sets the foundation for innovative and effective solution design
- Prevents wasted effort on poorly defined or misunderstood problems

## Key activities:

### 1. Synthesize research
- Collate and analyze all data and insights from the Explore phase
- Identify key themes, patterns, and contradictions in your findings

### 2. Define the problem statement
- Articulate the core problem clearly and concisely
- Ensure the problem statement reflects user needs and community context

### 3. Challenge assumptions
- Critically examine existing beliefs about the problem and potential solutions
- Encourage diverse perspectives to uncover hidden biases or oversights

### 4. Identify success criteria
- Define what success looks like for your project
- Establish measurable goals and outcomes

### 5. Prioritize focus areas
- Determine which aspects of the problem to address first
- Consider factors like impact, feasibility, and resource availability

### 6. Create a design brief
- Document your problem statement, target users, goals, and constraints
- Use this brief to guide your team in the subsequent Create phase

### 7. Align stakeholders
- Present your reframed problem and approach to key stakeholders
- Ensure buy-in and shared understanding before moving forward

:::note[Remember]
Reframing is about gaining clarity and focus. Don't rush this phase â€“ a well-defined problem is crucial for developing effective solutions.
