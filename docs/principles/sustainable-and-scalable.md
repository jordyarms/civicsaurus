Creating sustainable and scalable solutions in civic tech means designing projects with longevity and growth in mind. This principle emphasizes building solutions that can be maintained over time, expanded to serve more people, and potentially replicated in other contexts.

## Why it matters:

- Ensures long-term impact of civic tech projects
- Maximizes the return on invested time and resources
- Allows successful solutions to grow and benefit more people
- Facilitates knowledge transfer and replication of effective models
- Builds resilience in civic tech ecosystems

## What it means:

1. **Long-term Planning**:  Consider the long-term viability of your solution from the start, including maintenance and evolution.
2. **Modular Design**:  Build solutions in a modular way, allowing for easier maintenance, updates, and expansion.
3. **Documentation**:  Create clear, comprehensive documentation to support ongoing development and potential replication.
4. **Knowledge Transfer**:  Implement processes for sharing knowledge within the team and with the wider community.
5. **Resource Efficiency**:  Design solutions that make efficient use of available resources, both technical and human.
6. **Replicability**:  Consider how your solution could be adapted or replicated in different contexts or communities.

Sustainability isn't just about keeping a project running; it's about creating lasting value and enabling growth and adaptation over time.
