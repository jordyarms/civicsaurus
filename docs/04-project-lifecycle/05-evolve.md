title: 3.5 Evolve 
description: Decide on the next steps for your project. This could mean growing it, handing it off, or winding it down based on how it's working and what the community needs.

Once your project is out in the world, it might take different paths. This phase is about recognizing when your project needs to change direction and how to handle that change.

Change is a normal part of any project's lifecycle. Be open to different outcomes and focus on what's best for your community.

:::tip
Regular check-ins on your project's direction can help you spot the need for change early
:::

## Why it matters:

* Projects often need to adapt as community needs change  
* Some projects fulfill their purpose and need to wind down  
* Others might be ready to grow beyond your original team  
* Understanding these possibilities helps you plan and make tough decisions

## Key activities:

1. Assess your project's current state  
   * Look at usage data, community feedback, and resource requirements  
   * Consider if the project is still meeting its original goals  
2. Explore different paths  
   * Continuing: Keep running and improving the project  
   * Scaling: Grow the project to serve more people or address new needs  
   * Handing off: Transfer the project to another organization or government  
   * Hibernating: Put the project on pause if it's not currently needed  
   * Retiring: Wind down the project if it's completed its purpose  
3. Plan for transitions  
   * If handing off, document everything clearly for the new owners  
   * If retiring, communicate clearly with users and archive the work  
   * If scaling, consider what new resources or partnerships you'll need  
4. Learn and share  
   * Reflect on what worked well and what you'd do differently  
   * Share your experiences with the civic tech community
