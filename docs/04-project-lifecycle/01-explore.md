title: 3.1 Discover 
description: Get to know your community and the problem you're trying to solve. Talk to people, observe, and gather information.

This is where you learn about your community and the problem you're trying to solve. You'll do research to understand people's needs, how the community works, and what's already out there.

Stay open-minded during this phase. Your goal is to learn, not to jump to solutions right away.

:::tip
Include your team and community members in the research. It helps everyone understand the problem better.
