title: 3.4 Catalyze 
description: Implement your solution, measure its impact, and scale its reach. Focus on adoption, sustainability, and continuous improvement.
---

The Catalyze phase is about bringing your solution to life, scaling its impact, and ensuring its long-term sustainability. This phase focuses on implementation, adoption, and continuous improvement of your civic tech project.

## Why it matters:

- Transforms ideas and prototypes into real-world impact
- Ensures the solution is adopted and used effectively by the community
- Establishes processes for ongoing maintenance and improvement
- Measures and demonstrates the value of your civic tech project
- Sets the foundation for scaling and potentially replicating your solution

## Key activities:

### 1. Develop and launch
- Build out the full version of your solution based on validated prototypes
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure reliability and security
- Plan and execute a strategic launch to your target users

### 2. User onboarding and support
- Create clear, accessible user guides and documentation
- Develop a support system to assist users and address issues
- Provide training or workshops to key user groups if necessary

### 3. Monitor and evaluate
- Implement analytics and feedback mechanisms to track usage and impact
- Regularly collect and analyze data on key performance indicators
- Conduct ongoing user research to understand evolving needs and experiences

### 4. Iterate and improve
- Use insights from monitoring and evaluation to make continuous improvements
- Prioritize and implement updates based on user feedback and observed needs
- Stay responsive to changing community needs and technological advances

### 5. Build sustainability
- Develop a long-term maintenance and funding plan
- Foster community ownership and engagement with the project
- Establish partnerships for ongoing support and development

### 6. Scale and replicate
- Identify opportunities to expand the reach or functionality of your solution
- Document your process and learnings to facilitate replication in other contexts
- Engage with other civic tech communities to share knowledge and resources

### 7. Measure and communicate impact
- Collect and analyze data on the outcomes and impact of your project
- Create compelling narratives and visualizations to communicate your impact
- Share results with stakeholders, funders, and the broader civic tech community

:::note[Remember]
Catalyzing is an ongoing process. Your solution should continue to evolve and improve even after launch.

:::tip
Plan for sustainability from the start. Consider how your solution will be maintained and evolved over time, and build those considerations into your implementation strategy.
