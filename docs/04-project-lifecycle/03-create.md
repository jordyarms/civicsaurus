title: 3.3 Create 
description: Generate a wide range of potential solutions. Prototype, test, and iterate to develop the most promising ideas into viable civic tech solutions.
---

The Create phase is where you generate, prototype, and test potential solutions to address the problem you've defined. It's a highly iterative process that involves creative ideation, rapid prototyping, and continuous user feedback.

## Why it matters:

- Allows for exploration of multiple potential solutions
- Reduces risk by testing ideas before full implementation
- Ensures solutions are user-centered and effective
- Helps identify and resolve issues early in the development process
- Builds stakeholder confidence through tangible demonstrations

## Key activities:

### 1. Ideation
- Conduct brainstorming sessions to generate a wide range of potential solutions
- Encourage creative thinking and consider unconventional approaches
- Involve diverse participants to bring varied perspectives

### 2. Concept development
- Refine and combine ideas into coherent solution concepts
- Evaluate concepts against your problem statement and success criteria
- Select the most promising concepts for prototyping

### 3. Rapid prototyping
- Create low-fidelity prototypes to visualize and test key aspects of your solutions
- Use methods appropriate to your project (e.g., paper prototypes, wireframes, mock-ups)
- Focus on quickly demonstrating core functionality and user interactions

### 4. User testing
- Test prototypes with real users from your target community
- Gather feedback on usability, desirability, and potential impact
- Observe how users interact with your prototypes

### 5. Iteration
- Analyze user feedback and testing results
- Refine and improve your prototypes based on insights gained
- Repeat the prototyping and testing cycle as needed

### 6. Technical feasibility assessment
- Evaluate the technical requirements and constraints of your proposed solutions
- Consult with developers and other technical experts as needed

### 7. Stakeholder reviews
- Present prototypes and testing results to key stakeholders
- Gather input and ensure alignment with organizational goals and constraints


:::note[Remember]
The Create phase is about learning and refining. Embrace the iterative process and don't be afraid to pivot if your testing reveals better approaches.

:::tip
Involve users throughout the Create phase, not just in testing. Consider co-design sessions where users actively participate in generating and refining solutions.
