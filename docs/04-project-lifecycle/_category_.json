    "description": "Every civic tech project goes through different stages. Here's a simple breakdown of how your project might evolve. Remember, these stages aren't a strict rulebook. You might jump back and forth between them as you learn new things. The key is to keep talking to the people you're helping and be ready to change course if needed.  Don't feel like you have to do everything perfectly. Start where you can, and use the parts that make sense for your project. The goal is to create something useful for your community, not to follow a perfect process."
