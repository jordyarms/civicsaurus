title: 3.2 Define 
description: Figure out exactly what needs fixing. This is where you narrow down your focus based on what you learned.
---
This is where you make sense of what you've learned and pinpoint the real problem you want to solve. You'll challenge your assumptions and set a clear direction for your project.

Take your time with this phase. A well-defined problem makes it much easier to find good solutions.

## Key activities:

1. Synthesize research  
   * Collate and analyze all data and insights from the Explore phase  
   * Identify key themes, patterns, and contradictions in your findings  
2. Define the problem statement  
   * Articulate the core problem clearly and concisely  
   * Ensure the problem statement reflects user needs and community context  
3. Challenge assumptions  
   * Critically examine existing beliefs about the problem and potential solutions  
   * Encourage diverse perspectives to uncover hidden biases or oversights  
4. Identify success criteria  
   * Define what success looks like for your project  
   * Establish measurable goals and outcomes  
5. Prioritize focus areas  
   * Determine which aspects of the problem to address first  
   * Consider factors like impact, feasibility, and resource availability  
6. Create a design brief  
   * Document your problem statement, target users, goals, and constraints  
   * Use this brief to guide your team in the subsequent Create phase  
7. Align stakeholders  
   * Present your reframed problem and approach to key stakeholders  
   * Ensure buy-in and shared understanding before moving forward
