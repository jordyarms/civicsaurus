Openness and transparency are cornerstone principles in civic tech. They involve sharing our work, processes, and decision-making openly with the community, fostering trust, collaboration, and shared ownership of civic solutions.

## Why it matters:

- Builds trust between projects and the community
- Encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Enables wider participation and contribution
- Ensures accountability in the use of resources
- Facilitates project sustainability and replication

## What it means:

1. **Open Source Development**:  Make your project's source code publicly available and encourage community contributions.
2. **Open Data**:  Use and produce open data, ensuring it's accessible and understandable to the public.
3. **Transparent Decision-Making**: Clearly communicate project goals, progress, and the rationale behind key decisions.
4. **Clear Communication**:  Use plain language to explain your project and maintain open channels for community feedback.
5. **Open Collaboration**:  Create opportunities for diverse participation throughout the project lifecycle.
6. **Proper Licensing**:  Use appropriate open licenses and give proper attribution to foster a culture of sharing.


:::note[Remember]
Openness is not just about making things public, but about creating an environment where collaboration and shared ownership can thrive.
