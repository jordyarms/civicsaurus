Being user-centered and inclusive in civic tech means designing solutions that work for all members of the community, regardless of their background, abilities, or tech-savviness. This principle ensures our projects address real needs and create value for the entire community.

## Why it matters:

- Increases project impact and adoption
- Ensures equitable access to civic solutions
- Builds trust between technology creators and the community
- Leads to more robust and versatile solutions

## What it means:

1. **Diverse User Research**:  Engage with a wide range of community members, including underrepresented groups, using various research methods.
2. **Inclusive Design**:  Create solutions that are accessible to people with different abilities, devices, and levels of digital literacy.
3. **Co-design and Participation**:  Involve community members in the design process from the start and create opportunities for ongoing participation.
4. **Continuous User Testing**:  Regularly test with diverse user groups and iterate based on feedback and observed behaviors.
5. **Measure Inclusivity**:  Set inclusivity goals, monitor usage data, and seek qualitative feedback to ensure your solution benefits all intended users.

:::note[Remember]
True inclusivity goes beyond accessibility. It's about creating solutions that resonate with and empower all members of the community, fostering a sense of ownership and engagement.
