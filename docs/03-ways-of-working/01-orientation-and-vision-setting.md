title: 2.1 Vision Setting
description: Establish a clear direction for your project, and align team members and stakeholders around common goals and values.

Civic tech projects seldom move in a straight line (and that’s OK\!). But successful projects invest the time up front to craft a clear and compelling vision and roadmap for their work.

## Why it matters for project success:

Having a vision for your project, with goals and milestones, will help you stay motivated and prioritize your efforts. There are lots of little decisions to make throughout your project and a clear vision can help you align on the best way forward. 

A clear and compelling vision also helps you attract volunteers or convince stakeholders to lend you their time or resources. 

## What it looks like in practice:

1. **Define your purpose and vision:**  Work as a team to articulate why your project exists, what community need it addresses and what principles will guide you. You should be able to summarize this in a single sentence, e.g. “"We're building a tool to help residents easily report and track local infrastructure issues, making our city more responsive and transparent."
2. **Set clear goals and milestones:**  Establish concrete, measurable objectives that align with your overall purpose. And even though your team is volunteering their time, don’t be afraid of setting deadlines.
3. **Revisit regularly:**  Make time to review and refine your vision and roadmap, so you can adapt to changes in circumstance or incorporate what you’re learning. Think of your vision as a set of [strong opinions, weakly held](https://medium.com/@ameet/strong-opinions-weakly-held-a-framework-for-thinking-6530d417e364).
